# Complexity_Index


This set of MATLAB m-files implement a novel complexity index for time series describing a complex system.
I have presented this novel complexity index in every functional neuroimaging modality in a recent paper [1].

We have adapted this novel complexity index in conjunction with famous Lempel -Ziv complexity
in two MEG datasets,  one with mild traumatic brain injury and healthy control subjects [2]
one with dsylexic children and healthy controls [3].
In both datasets, we reported higher classification performance for detecting reading children and
mild traumatic brain inured subjects versus healthy controls with our novel complexity index
compared to Lempel -Ziv complexity.

If you use this dataset for any case, please cite mainly reference no.1
